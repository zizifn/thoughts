      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>
        Outside the space-warp chamber, Rizal's great green sun had already set.
        Thick olive dusk eddied through the interplanetary transit center. I
        swore under my breath and slammed shut the warp-hatch switch.
      </p>
      <p>
        Locking bars whispered back. The hatch revolved on its axis, slow as an
        asteroid eroding. I threw another quick glance at my chrono. It still
        read the same as before: six Earth hours more… six hours to ferret out
        the truth or be forever reconditioned.
      </p>
      <p>
        —Six hours, that is, if Controller Alfred Kruze didn't cut it shorter.
      </p>
      <p>
        And if he did, Rizal might very well change status. Today, it was billed
        as the FedGov's outermost bastion against the Kel. Tomorrow, it could
        prove man's fatal flaw, the Achilles heel in our whole system of
        defenses.
      </p>
      <p>In which case—</p>
      <p>Involuntarily, I shivered.</p>
      <p>“Agent Traynor—?”</p>
      <p>
        The voice came from the shadows. A dull, phlegmatic, tranquilized,
        conditioned voice. I stopped short; turned fast. “Who's asking?”
      </p>
      <p>
        The man shrugged stolidly, not even picking up my tension. “I'm a port
        rep, Agent Traynor. Port rep second, that is—”
      </p>

      <p>“So who told you to come out here? Who said you should meet me?”</p>
      <p>
        “Oh…” A pause. “Well, you see, there's this sigman, Agent Traynor. Up in
        the Interworld Communications section. He had a regular 7-D clearance
        report that a FedGov Security investigation agent was warping in—you
        have to file a 7-D on all warpings, you know, Agent Traynor, on account
        of restrictives. So—well, the rep first was out to eat, so I just
        notified Rizal Security, just a routine report, and the unit controller
        there, an Agent Gaylord, he said for me to meet you, and—”
      </p>
      <p>
        I bit down hard and shifted my weight, both at once, wondering if a
        broken jaw would interfere with the work of a port rep second.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only then, all at once, I caught the unmistakable whish of a grav-car
        sweeping in.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lights hit us almost in the same instant. Two seconds later a man
        who said he was Agent Gaylord was jumping down and locking wrists with
        me in Rizal's traditional greeting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even that wrist-lock set my teeth on edge. It was too solid, too stolid,
        too thorough a job of conditioning.
      </p>
      <p>Or was it maybe, just a trifle over-done?</p>
