        It is advisable to drain golfing land much more thoroughly and
        efficiently than ordinary farm land, but, on the other hand, by
        exercising a little thought it can be done much more cheaply. For the
        purpose of golf it is not only unnecessary to drain as deeply as is
        customary for agricultural purposes, but it is much cheaper and more
        satisfactory to adopt a system of shallow drains.
