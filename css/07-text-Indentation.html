        This is a paragraph that has been indented, using the
        <em>first-letter</em> pseudo-element. Normally, we can't apply CSS
        directly to text, but this pseudo-element acts as an invisible "span"
        that wraps around the first character.
      </p>
      <p>
        Indentation isn't super common on the web, but it's everywhere in print
        media! Most published books will use indentation like this, and will
        only add space between paragraphs at the end of a "section" or
        sub-chapter.

        This paragraph has been justify-aligned. The goal with justify-aligned
        text is to create a sharp block of text that aligns both on the left and
        right edges. It accomplishes this goal by tweaking the spacing between
        each word. Historically, this process was painstakingly done by
        typographers, using their intuition and a hearty amount of hyphens to
        create well-formatted text.
