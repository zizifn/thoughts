# Fundamentals Recap

# Units

- For typography, I generally use **rem**, because it has important accessibility benefits.
- When it comes to properties that relate to the box model — padding, border, margin — I usually use **pixels**. It's more intuitive than rem, and there isn't a clear accessibility win.
- For width/height, it'll depend on whether I want the element to be a **fixed size**, or a relative size. I might want one div to always be 250px wide, while another one should be **50%** of the available space.
- For color, as we saw in the last lesson, I prefer **okhcl**.
